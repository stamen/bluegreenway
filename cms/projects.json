Exit at Evans Ave. and Middle Point Road. Continue on foot down Evans; it'll curve into Hunters Point Blvd. Turn left on Hawes Street and the park will be at the very end. The history of India Basin is a curious combination of industry and open space, business and pleasure. The name India Basin first appeared on a map in 1868, but theories as to its origin remain murky. The best guess is that India Basin is named for the ships from the India Rice Mill Company which docked there. A more creative explanation has it that it was so named because water from nearby springs would stay fresh until a ship reached India. By 1890, India Basin buzzed with activity from its extensive dry-docks and shipyards. Jack London's ship, the Snark, was built there, as were several Chinese junks used in the film 'Blood Alley,' starring John Wayne. India Basin boomed again during the war years, when it was used as a marina. Sailors crossed the rough and tumble bars of Third Street, and the area reeked of the stench from the nearby meat- packing houses of Butchertown. Source: Peter Woodall By the early 1970s, activity in the basin had declined dramatically. Butchertown was redeveloped into a large industrial park in an effort to revitalize the area, but shipping never recovered. In August 1999, India Basin Shoreline Park was named a Renaissance Park by Mayor Willie Brown. Supervised by the Trust for Public Land, Renaissance activities began with community outreach focusing on India Basin's location on the Bay Trail, better access to the park, and a survey of improvements needed when the park expands onto land already owned by the Recreation and Park Department. The outreach included quarterly newsletters sent to all nearby homes and businesses, presentations to community groups and residence organizations, visits to the park on heavy-use days, and a park cleanup day, with free pizza for the volunteers. Still in the planning stage is construction of a bridge that would span the adjacent PG&amp;E power plant and link India Basin Park with Heron's Head Park, which is owned by the Port of San Francisco. Work on the next phase of the park's improvement begins in September, 2000, with $179,300 in funding from the Open Space Committee, the Community Development Building Grant, and the San Francisco Conservation Corps, along with $378,000 from the Trust for Public Land. The project includes completing the Bay Trail through the India Basin Park, expanding green spaces, grading, fencing, some planting, and installing benches, a playground and a basketball court. 'We have been wanting these features since the neighborhood first initiated a park plan in 1978,' says Friends of India Basin's Jill Fox. The Friends are now seeking additional funding for a water fountain, educational signage and a children's art project. Completion is scheduled for June 2001. In November of this year, action begins on an undeveloped part of the park separated by private property. The project includes shoreline access, wetlands and upland plantings, signage, Bay Trail access and seating areas. The project is scheduled for completion in June, 2001. 'The project is an outstanding model for converting a bleak industrial landscape into a beautiful neighborhood resource,' Fox declares. She notes that the Renaissance Park designation coordinated outreach, design and construction schedules and established the necessary connections among city agencies, community organizations and funders. 'By combining the expanded India Basin Shoreline Park with nearby Heron's Head Park and the Bay trail,' she says, 'the Renaissance plan created both a stunning neighborhood recreation area and a regional destination.' - Jill Fox, Friends of India Basin <strong>Park Groups</strong> Friends of India Basin Jill Fox (415) 285-9211, <a href=\"mailto:jillfox1@earthlink.net\">jillfox1@earthlink.net</a>\"</p>\n","Links":"<p>India Basin Neighborhood Association (IBNA):<a href=\"http://www.indiabasin.org/index.htm\">http://www.indiabasin.org/index.htm</a></p>\n","Facilities":null,"Accessible":null,"Hours":null,"Parking":null,"Restrooms":null,"URL":"http://dev.sfparksalliance.org/our-parks/parks/india-basinshoreline-park?popup=1","Post date":"05/10/2012 - 3:56pm","Updated date":"04/20/2016 - 3:52pm"}},{"node":{"id":"391","Name":"Islais Creek","Location Category":"Park or Playground","Is BGW":"1","BGW Zone":"Mission Bay/Mission Rock","Timeline Percent Complete":null,"Address":"<div class=\"location vcard\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/PostalAddress\">\n  <div class=\"adr\">\n          <span class=\"fn\" itemprop=\"name\">Arthur Ave and Quint St.</span>\n              <div class=\"street-address\">\n        <span itemprop=\"streetAddress\">Arthur &amp; Quint</span>\n              </div>\n                                                            <span class=\"geo\"><abbr class=\"latitude\" title=\"37.746471\">37\u00b0 44' 47.2956\" N</abbr>, <abbr\n            class=\"longitude\" title=\"-122.388023\">122\u00b0 23' 16.8828\" W</abbr></span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"map-link\">\n      <div class=\"location map-link\">See map: <a href=\"http://maps.google.com?q=37.746471+-122.388023+%28Arthur+%26+Quint%2C+San+Francisco%2C+CA%2C+%2C+us%29\">Google Maps</a></div>    </div>\n  </div>\n","Description":"<p>This new park contains a broad promenade which is soon to be joined by a second one.

Bus: 19-Polk Established: 1988 History: 'Where in the world is Islais Creek?' was the question most often asked 12 years ago when the Friends of Islais Creek started to create a small, green park by the Third Street draw bridge. The Ohlone Indians would have known. They harvested mussels, clams, and shrimp on its shores long before the Europeans arrived in 1769. The creek appeared on Mexican maps in 1834, named for Los Islais (is-lay-is), a hollyleaf cherry and favorite Indian food. On today's map it is the gateway to (the former) Butchertown, the Bayview and Hunters Point. In the 1850s Islais Creek provided fresh water to Franciscan friars from Mission Dolores and irrigated the produce that Portuguese, Italian, and Irish vegetable farmers grew in the Bayview district. The Gold Rush marked the start of the creek's decline when hordes of forty-niners swarmed out of the city and settled into the makeshift housing on the water's edge. In 1870, the slaughterhouses of Butchertown came in, and Islais Creek, red with blood and offal, reeking of garbage, sewage, and unfit for any use, was diverted to a culvert and its contents sent out to the Bay. Until the 1950s, the waterway was an open sewer, known colloquially as 'S___ Creek.' Things changed in the 1970s with construction of a water treatment plant nearby and the clearing out of Buchertown's auto-wrecking yards. They changed even more when new houses were built on Stony Hill and Julia Viera moved into one in 1984. Her hilltop view of the channel's desolate mile of trash-bordered water moved her to action. An energetic environmentalist, she organized Friends of Islais Creek, a gutsy, visionary neighborhood group committed to creating a waterfront park and restoring the creek. Their crusade for the little park by the drawbridge was launched in 1988 with a $50,000 grant from the State Department of Water Resources and the participation of the Bayview community, the SF Conservation Corps, Milestones (a half-way house for parolees) and Horace Mann Middle School. Learning that four public agencies were planning major construction projects, none aware of the others, Friends brought together a task force from MUNI, the Department of Public Works, the Public Utilities Commission, the Port of San Francisco, and CalTrans. --Jeanne Alexander, Neighborhood Parks Council <strong>Park Groups</strong> Friends of Islais Creek Julia Viera, (415) 826-5669\"</p>\n","Links":"<p><a href=\"http://www.sfnpc.org/islaiscreekhistory?phpMyAdmin=6o6xh-MUN0rKl82PPMWyiPYTZNc\">http://www.sfnpc.org/islaiscreekhistory?phpMyAdmin=6o6xh-MUN0rKl82PPMWyi...</a><a href=\"http://www.islaiscreek.org\">http://www.islaiscreek.org</a></p>\n","Facilities":"<p>Port</p>\n","Accessible":null,"Hours":null,"Parking":null,"Restrooms":null,"URL":"http://dev.sfparksalliance.org/our-parks/parks/islais-creek?popup=1","Post date":"05/10/2012 - 3:56pm","Updated date":"04/20/2016 - 3:51pm"}},{"node":{"id":"5935","Name":"Mission Bay/Mission Rock - test","Location Category":"Other","Is BGW":"1","BGW Zone":"Mission Bay/Mission Rock","Timeline Percent Complete":null,"Address":"<div class=\"location vcard\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/PostalAddress\">\n  <div class=\"adr\">\n                                                                <span class=\"geo\"><abbr class=\"latitude\" title=\"37.774930\">37\u00b0 46' 29.748\" N</abbr>, <abbr\n            class=\"longitude\" title=\"-122.419416\">122\u00b0 25' 9.8976\" W</abbr></span>\n            </div>\n      <div class=\"map-link\">\n      <div class=\"location map-link\">See map: <a href=\"http://maps.google.com?q=37.774930+-122.419416+%28%2C+San+Francisco%2C+CA%2C+%2C+us%29\">Google Maps</a></div>    </div>\n  </div>\n","Description":"<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0392417d-e3f4-a39e-4475-5b59702f40b5\"><span style=\"font-size: 14.6667px; font-family: Arial; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;\">In recent years, the northern portion of the Blue Greenway has undergone many renovations.
